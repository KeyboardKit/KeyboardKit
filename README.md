# KeyboardKit

KeyboardKit lets you create amazing [custom keyboard extensions][About] with a few lines of code, using Swift & SwiftUI.

KeyboardKit extends Apple's limited keyboard APIs with more capabilities. It can be extended with [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro], which unlocks localized keyboards, autocomplete, an emoji keyboard, AI support, themes, and much more.


## Installation

KeyboardKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKit.git
```

Since KeyboardKit is a binary framework, it must only linked to the main app target. All other targets will be able to use it without linking.



## Getting Started

The easiest way to set up KeyboardKit is to first create a `KeyboardApp` value for your app:

```swift
import KeyboardKit

extension KeyboardApp {

    static var keyboardKitDemo: KeyboardApp {
        .init(
            name: "KeyboardKit",
            licenseKey: "your-key-here",                // Needed for KeyboardKit Pro!
            appGroupId: "group.com.keyboardkit.demo",   // Sets up App Group data sync
            locales: .keyboardKitSupported,             // Sets up the enabled locales
            autocomplete: .init(                        // Sets up custom autocomplete  
                nextWordPredictionRequest: .claude(...) // Sets up AI-based prediction
            ),
            deepLinks: .init(app: "kkdemo://", ...)     // Defines how to open the app
        )
    }
}
```  

Next, let your `KeyboardController` inherit ``KeyboardInputViewController`` instead of `UIInputViewController`:

```swift
class KeyboardController: KeyboardInputViewController {}
```

This unlocks additional functions and capabilities, and adds `services` and observable `state` to the controller. 

Next, override `viewDidLoad()` and call `setup(for:)` to set up the keyboard extension for your app:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        // Set up the keyboard with the app we created above
        setup(for: .keyboardKitDemo) { result in
            // If `result` is `.success`, the setup did succeed.
            // This is where you can setup custom services, etc.
        }
    }
}
```

This will make keyboard settings sync data between the main app and its keyboard if the `KeyboardApp` defines an ``appGroupId``, set up KeyboardKit Pro if it defines a ``licenseKey``, set up dictation and deep links, etc.

To replace or customize the standard ``KeyboardView``, just override `viewWillSetupKeyboardView()` and let it call `setupKeyboardView(_:)` with the view that you want to use:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewWillSetupKeyboardView() {
        setupKeyboardView { [weak self] controller in // <-- Use weak or unknowned self!
            KeyboardView(
                state: controller.state,
                services: controller.services,
                buttonContent: { $0.view },
                buttonView: { $0.view },
                collapsedView: { $0.view },
                emojiKeyboard: { $0.view },
                toolbar: { $0.view }
            )
        }
    }
}
```

To set up your main app with the same keyboard configuration, just wrap the content view in a `KeyboardAppView`:

```swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
        
            // Here we use the keyboard app we created above
            KeyboardAppView(for: .keyboardKitDemo) {
                ContentView()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Documentation

The [online documentation][Documentation] has a getting-started guide, feature articles, code samples, developer guides, etc.



## Demo App

The `Demo` folder has a demo app that shows how to set up a main app and its keyboard extension, show keyboard status, provide in-app settings, link to system settings, apply custom styles, etc.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The demo isn't code signed and can therefore not use an App Group to sync settings between the app and its keyboards. As such, the `KeyboardPro` keyboard has keyboard settings in the keyboard as well.



## KeyboardKit App

The [KeyboardKit app][KeyboardKit-App] on the App Store lets you download and try KeyboardKit without having to write any code.



## Support This Project

KeyboardKit is free to use, but you can support us by becoming a [GitHub Sponsor][Sponsors], upgrading to [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] or [get in touch][Email] for freelance work, paid support etc.
