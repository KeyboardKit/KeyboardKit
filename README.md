## About KeyboardKit

KeyboardKit is a SwiftUI SDK that lets you create fully customizable [keyboard extensions][About] with a few lines of code.

KeyboardKit extends Apple's limited keyboard APIs, extends the input controller and proxy with more capabilities, and provides you with additional functionality, states and views, to let you build an outstanding, custom keyboards.

</p>

KeyboardKit is open-source and completely free. It can be extended with [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] to unlock Pro features, like localized keyboards, autocomplete & autocorrect, AI support, an emoji keyboard, themes, dictation, and more.



## Installation

KeyboardKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKit.git
```

After installing KeyboardKit, make sure to link it to all targets that need it.



## Getting Started

To use KeyboardKit in a keyboard extension, just inherit the KeyboardKit ``KeyboardInputViewController`` instead of `UIInputViewController`:

```swift
import KeyboardKit

class KeyboardController: KeyboardInputViewController {}
```

This gives your controller access to new lifecycle functions like `viewWillSetupKeyboard`, observable state like `state.keyboardContext`, services like `services.actionHandler`, and much more.

If you just want to use the standard `KeyboardView`, which mimics a native iOS keyboard, you don't have to do anything else. KeyboardKit will set up an English keyboard for you.

To replace or customize the standard `KeyboardView`, just override `viewWillSetupKeyboard` and call `setup` with the view you want to use:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewWillSetupKeyboard() {
        super.viewWillSetupKeyboard()
        setup { [weak self] controller in // <-- Use [weak self] or [unowned self] if you need self here.
            KeyboardView(
                state: controller.state,
                services: controller.services,
                buttonContent: { $0.view },
                buttonView: { $0.view },
                emojiKeyboard: { $0.view },
                toolbar: { _ in MyCustomToolbar() }
            )
        }
    }
}
```

For more information, please see the [getting started guide][Getting-Started].
