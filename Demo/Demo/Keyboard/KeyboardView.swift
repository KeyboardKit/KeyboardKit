/**
 This is the main view that is registered when the extension
 runs `setup(with:)` in ``KeyboardViewController``. The view
 is used by all `SystemKeyboard`-based keyboards.
 
 The view must observe a `KeyboardContext` as an environment
 object, or take a context instance as an init parameter and
 set it to an observed object. Otherwise, it will not change
 when the context changes. This is not how it should be, but
 I have not yet figured out why this is needed.
