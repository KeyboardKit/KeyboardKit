/// This is the KeyboardKit demo app.
///
/// The main app target shows you how `KeyboardKit Pro` lets
/// you create a great keyboard app, in which a user can set
/// up and configure the keyboard in in-app settings screens.
/// The `Keyboard` keyboard uses `KeyboardKit` to show basic
/// keyboard usage while `KeyboardPro` uses `KeyboardKit Pro`
/// to unlock localized layouts, emojis, settings, etc.
///
/// To run this demo on a physical device, you must register
/// your development team under `Signing & Capabilities` for
/// all three targets.
///
/// `IMPORTANT` This demo has no App Group by default, which
/// means that keyboard settings won't sync between the main
/// app and its keyboards. This is why the `KeyboardPro` has
/// in-keyboard settings screens. To make settings sync, you
/// have to change the bundle ID of all targets, then create
/// an App Group in the Apple Developer Portal and add it to
/// all three targets, then change the `appGroupId` value in
/// `KeyboardApp+Demo.swift`.
