/// The view shows how to customize the keyboard view, where
/// you return `$0.view` (or `params in params.view`) to use
/// the default component view, or return a custom view that
/// you want to replace the default one with.
///
/// This view replaces the default toolbar with a Pro toggle
/// toolbar that lets users toggle between two toolbars.
