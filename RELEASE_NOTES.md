# Release notes

KeyboardKit tries to honor semantic versioning:

* Deprecations can happen at any time.
* Deprecations should only be removed in `major` updates.
* Breaking changes should not occur in `minor` and `patch` updates.
* Breaking changes *can* occur in `minor` and `patch` updates, if needed.

These release notes only cover the current major version. 


### ‚ÄºÔ∏è Important information

KeyboardKit 8.8 currently has a lot of deprecations, since the structure is being changed and types being renamed to make the upcoming 9.0 a lot cleaner.

These changes don't affect `KeyboardActionHandler` (where handler is a better name than service) and `KeyboardStyleProvider` which is most probably removed in 9.0. 

KeyboardKit 9 is planned to be released shortly after the public release of iOS 18 and all corresponding OS versions. It will also bump the deployment target to iOS 15.



## 8.8.7

This version re-adds the old way of opening URLs, with iOS 18 support.

This version makes the dictation service use an `OpenURLAction` to return to the previous app, since a keyboard action handler can't resolve a proper controller within the main app.

### ‚ú® Features

* `UrlOpener` is a new protocol with a default way to open a URL.

### üí° Adjustments

* `KeyboardAction.url` will once again render as full gesture views.

### üëë KeyboardKit Pro

* `Dictation+ProKeyboardService` now logs when the App Group configuration seems wrong.
* `Dictation+ProKeyboardService` now lets you provide a `OpenURLAction` in the main app.
* `KeyboardHostApplicationProvider` has a new `hostApplicationBundleIdIsKnown` property.
* `View+Dictation` now lets provide a `OpenURLAction` to use to return to the previous app.

### üêõ Bug fixes

* `Dictation.ProKeyboardService` has now sets the dictation locale more reliably.
* `Dictation.ProKeyboardService` has now handle background thread state updates better. 



## 8.8.6

This version fixes things that break in Xcode 16 and iOS 18.

First of all, it makes multi-gesture buttons work in scroll views, when building from Xcode 16 and running on iOS 18. This is required for the KeyboardKit Pro emoji keyboard to work.
 
Second, this version makes `.url` keyboard actions render as SwiftUI `Link`s, since iOS 18 can no longer open URLs using the selector-based approach.

### ‚ú® Features

* `GestureButton` is a new inline dependency.
* `Image` has a new `.keyboardUrl` extension.

### üí° Adjustments

* `GestureButton` is used for all buttons instead of the deprecated one.
* `KeyboardAction.url` will by default use the new `.keyboardUrl` image.
* `KeyboardAction.url` will by default render as a plain `SwiftUI` `Link`.

### üêõ Bug fixes

* `Dictation.DisabledKeyboardService` now resets its context on the main queue, which silences a background thread warning. 

### üóëÔ∏è Deprecations

* `Gestures.GestureButton` and some related types have been deprecated.



## 8.8.4

### üêõ Bug fixes

* This patch fixes a `KeyboardAppView` bug that caused the locale to be strictly set to the first locale in the license, which did reset any manual changes. 



## 8.8.2

This version fixes a keyboard button gesture bug.

### üêõ Bug fixes

* `Gestures.GestureButton` will now automatically cancel its pressed state if it hasn't received a second gesture event within 3 seconds. 



## 8.8.1

This version fixes a few inconsistencies and bugs.

### üí° Adjustments

* `Autocomplete.ToolbarStyle` adjusts the minimum height from `50` to `48` to align closer with the native keyboards, while still leaving room for the standard callouts.

### üëë KeyboardKit Pro

* `Autocomplete.LocalService` now correctly regards lexicon suggestions as pure complementary, since they (as they should) ignore the current casing, and therefore can mess up capitalization when typing.  



## 8.8

This version continues to rename types to make things more consistent in the 9.0 release. This means that are currently many deprecated names (which may be confusing), but it's all in service for a clean 9.0.

This version also adds a new `KeyboardApp` type that can be used to define all information for your app. This makes it easy to keep all app-specific information in one place, set up the main app target, etc.

This version also adds a new `KeyboardAppView` view that can automatically set up main app to use App Group synced settings, register your KeyboardKit Pro license (if any), etc. This removes a lot of manual work.

This version deprecates the recently added settings types, and replaces them with adding persistency to the various context properties instead. This avoids having to keep the contexts in sync with the settings.

This version adds support for Emoji 15.1, which adds a bunch of new emojis, and also adds memory optimized emoji keyboard styles, which make the emoji keyboard consume a LOT less memory, by rendering lower resolution grid items. 

This version also tweaks the emoji keyboard configuration for all device types, to make the emoji keyboard look a lot closer to the native emoji keyboard on all device types, including 13" iPads, in both portrait and landscape.

KeyboardKit Pro adds new settings screens, like `KeyboardApp.SettingsScreen` and `KeyboardApp.LocaleScreen`, which makes it a lot easier than before to add keyboard settings to the main app target, as well as to the keyboard.


### üí• Breaking changes 

This version has one breaking change. Due to how settings are now handled, the `KeyboardSettings.store` no longer accept optional values. You can only replace this store with another valid store, and have a new `isStoreSynced` property to see if you've successfully set up an app group-synced store.

* `KeyboardAppearanceViewModifier` has been deprecated, since it didn't behave well.
* `KeyboardSettings` settings properties have been deprecated and moved to the context.



## 8.7.2

This patch defers some heavy memory allocations that is unintentionally caused by the emoji keyboard, by only loading the keyboard when it's requested.

While the emoji keyboard may still cause memory pressure in keyboard extensions that load other heavy components into memory, it will not affect these keyboards on load.

The memory issues are described in a GitHub issue, and seems to be caused by SwiftUI. You can reproduce it by just adding the emoji keyboard to the extension and scroll through the categories.

This memory issue is a top priority, that must be fixed in the upcoming 8.8.

### ‚ú® Features

* `Callouts.DisabledActionProvider` is a new, disabled action provider.
* `KeyboardLayout.DisabledProvider` is a new, disabled layout provider.

### üåê Localization

### üí° Adjustments

* `SystemKeyboard` only loads the emoji keyboard when the keyboard type is `.emojis`.

### üêõ Bug fixes

* `Keyboard.Services` now properly applies an inverse offset for RTL locales.



## 8.7

This version improves the overall autocomplete behavior.

The local autocomplete service will now return proper unknown statuses and suggest any lexicon matches as autocorrections. The standard action handler will automatically ask the autocomplete provider to learn any applied unknown suggestions, if `isAutoLearnEnabled` is `true`.

This way to learn unknown suggestions will hopefully solve many frustrations involved with autocomplete, where the provider will behave better over time. Please provide feedback if these adjustments don't behave as expected.

The local autocomplete service can also perform next character prediction, by providing it with the typed text and a list of suggestions. This will be merged with the autocomplete operation in version 9.0.

The autocomplete context also has new ways of registering your own custom autocorrections for any locale, in case you find the default behavior to be lacking in some areas.

Furthermore, this version adds new persistent settings types, adds a `KeyboardLocaleInfo` protocol to make `KeyboardLocale` and `Locale` share many properties, and makes it possible to define which text to use when ending the current sentence. 

### üö® Important Information

* `AutocompleteService` and all implementations have been renamed to use the new `Service` name.
* `Autocomplete.LocalService` no longer caps suggestions by default. That responsibility is moved to the context.
* `Autocomplete.ToolbarItem` no longer adds quotations around unknown suggestions. That responsibility is moved to `AutocompleteService`. 
* `KeyboardInputViewController` now checks more things before performing autocomplete, for instance the keyboard context `prefersAutocomplete`.
* `KeyboardStyleProvider` and `Keyboard.ButtonStyle` now supports native `Font`s. This may cause some breaking changes that should be easy to fix.

### üÜï New Settings Types

## 8.6

This version adds support for 5 new locales, support for diacritics, and makes it easier to identify the host application. It also improves many of the localized system keyboards that are provided by Pro.

This version also changes the default autocomplete behavior, by making `KeyboardInputViewController` only use the pre-cursor part of the current word for autocomplete, which is how the native keyboard behaves. 

This version also makes KeyboardKit Pro no longer overwrite custom services that are set before registering a license. This means that you can now apply custom services at any time, without it being overwritten.

## 8.5

This version moves many types into their related namespaces, to make the SDK surface smaller and easier to overview. Since this involves many renamings, the `Deprecations` section below only lists deprecated types. 

The library has deprecation types to help you migrate to the new type names, so you should not run into any breaking changes when migrating from earlier versions to this one.

The `KeyboardState` namespace has been renamed to `KeyboardStatus`, since it was often confused with `Keyboard.KeyboardState`. `Keyboard.KeyboardState` & `Keyboard.KeyboardServices` have also been renamed to the shorter `Keyboard.State` and `Keyboard.Services`, since it reads better in code.

This version also makes it easier register custom audio and haptic feedback, in a way that now requires less or no customizations in the action handler. Just register any custom feedback for any gesture on any action, and it will be triggered by the standard action handler.

This version also makes the action and input callout bubbles look more native.

Finally, KeyboardKit Pro makes more locales use the new iPad Pro layout. It also provides a brand new `KeyboardApp.HomeScreen` that can be used as an app home screen, and a new `KeyboardStatus.Section` that can show all relevant statuses for a keyboard app.

## 8.0

Welcome to KeyboardKit 8.0 - a massive update to the KeyboardKit SDK!


### üì£ Major Changes

KeyboardKit 8.0 is all about cleaning up the library to make it better structured and easier to use. It removes previously deprecated code, moves types into namespaces, and removes low-value utilities, including types solely used for DocC exposure.

Central types like `SystemKeyboard` are easier to use. Passing state and services instead of a controller reduces the risk for memory leaks. It also no longer needs a width, but will take up as much space as it needs.

These updates has helped enabling new features, like fading the keyboard buttons while moving the cursor with space and other quality of life improvements and fixes. Accessibility has been drastically improved and the emoji keyboard redesigned.

Most emoji features are now Pro features, including the emoji keyboard. The `SystemKeyboard` automatically removes the emoji key if no emoji keyboard is available.

The documentation has been extensively updated to provide more information and code examples. Please report any inconsistencies found, as many changes have been made.

I hope that you will love this major update to KeyboardKit!


### üõü KeyboardKit 8 Migration Help

If you're a KeyboardKit 7 user, the best way to migrate to KeyboardKit 8 is to first upgrade to the last available 7.9 version. This version contains deprecations that helps you prepare for some of the changes in KeyboardKit 8.

As you then upgrade to KeyboardKit 8, the 8.0 release has many TEMPORARY deprecations to assist migration from KeyboardKit 7. These temporary deprecations will be removed in 8.1.

You may run into some breaking changes, since there are some type changes that can't be handled by these deprecations. I have tried to keep these to a minimum, but see the breaking changes section below if you run into any problems.
