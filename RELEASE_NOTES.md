# Release notes

[KeyboardKit](https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKit) honors semantic versioning, with the following strategy:

* Deprecations can happen at any time.
* Deprecations are removed in `major` updates.
* Breaking changes should only occur in `major` updates.
* Breaking changes *can* occur in `minor` and `patch` updates, if the alternative is worse.

Beta version tags and releases are removed after the next minor or major version. 

These release notes cover the current major version. See older versions for older release notes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> KeyboardKit 10 no longer has binary licenses encoded into the binary. You need a license file or a subscription license key. The license files use a new format, which means old license files no longer work. License file customer will receive an updated license file when KeyboardKit 10 is released. Until then, email us at  info@keyboardkit.com to get an updated license.

KeyboardKit 10 merges KeyboardKit and KeyboardKit Pro into a single, unified SDK that targets iOS 16, macOS 13, tvOS 16, watchOS 10, and visionOS 1.

There's a new üìã clipboard feature that can paste text from the system clipboard, of from a collection of user-created text clips. The new clipboard keyboard type will automatically switch to a clipboard screen that can paste from the keyboard.

There's a new ùìê fonts feature that makes it possible to type with a unicode font.

The local autocomplete service can now perform remote prediction, using requests. As a result, the remote service is not needed and has been removed and the local service has been renamed to `StandardAutocompleteService`.

The Pro settings screens have been improved, and separated into feature-specific screens. These screens expose more settings than before, and there are also more keyboard settings to let you and your users configure the typing behavior.   

Finally, the callout, layout and style services have been replaced by values and  view modifiers and have been removed from the library. All views use environment injections for observable state instead of init injection. SOme of these changes are breaking.
