Dictation can be used to enter text by speaking instead of typing. This can be complicated to set up for a keyboard extension, since a keyboard extensions can't access the microphone, but KeyboardKit makes it easy.

In KeyboardKit, a ``DictationService`` can start dictation from the keyboard extension by opening the main app, perform dictation in the app, then return to the keyboard and apply the dictated text when dictation completes.

ðŸ‘‘ [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a ``Dictation/StandardDictationService`` that can be used to perform dictation from the keyboard, as well as dictation-specific views and styles.



## Namespace

KeyboardKit has a ``Dictation`` namespace that contains dictation-related types, like ``Dictation/AuthorizationStatus``, as well as views that are unlocked by KeyboardKit Pro, like ``Dictation/Screen`` & ``Dictation/BarVisualizer``. 



## Context

KeyboardKit has a ``DictationContext`` that has observable dictation state, as well as auto-persisted, dictation-specific ``DictationContext/settings-swift.property``.

KeyboardKit automatically creates an instance of this class, injects it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/state`` and updates it whenever dictation is performed.



## Services

In KeyboardKit, a ``DictationService`` can start autocomplete from a keyboard by opening the main app and let it perform dictation, then return to the keyboard and apply the dictated text.

The open-source project doesn't include a dictation service. Instead, it injects a ``DictationService/disabled`` dictation service into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` until you register KeyboardKit Pro or inject your own service implementation.

ðŸ‘‘ [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a ``Dictation/StandardDictationService`` that can be used to perform dictation from a keyboard extension, by opening the main app and perform dictation there, then (if possible) return to the keyboard to apply the result.

KeyboardKit Pro will automatically register a standard dictation service as the main ``Keyboard/Services/dictationService`` when a license is registered.

## Speech Recognizer

The ``Dictation/StandardDictationService`` requires that you pass in a ``DictationSpeechRecognizer``. You can copy the source code for a standard speech recognizer implementation further down, that supports the following locales: 

Arabic (ar-SA), Cantonese (yue-CN), Catalan (ca-ES), Chinese (zh-CN), Chinese (zh-HK), Chinese (zh-TW), Croatian (hr-HR), Czech (cs-CZ), Danish (da-DK), Dutch (nl-BE), Dutch (nl-NL), English (en-AE), English (en-AU), English (en-CA), English (en-GB), English (en-ID), English (en-IE), English (en-IN), English (en-NZ), English (en-PH), English (en-SA), English (en-SG), English (en-US), English (en-ZA), Finnish (fi-FI), French (fr-BE), French (fr-CA), French (fr-CH), French (fr-FR), German (de-AT), German (de-CH), German (de-DE), Greek (el-GR), Hebrew (he-IL), Hindi (hi-IN), Hindi (hi-IN-translit), Hindi (hi-Latn), Hungarian (hu-HU), Indonesian (id-ID), Italian (it-CH), Italian (it-IT), Japanese (ja-JP), Korean (ko-KR), Malay (ms-MY), Norwegian BokmÃ¥l (nb-NO), Polish (pl-PL), Portuguese (pt-BR), Portuguese (pt-PT), Romanian (ro-RO), Russian (ru-RU), Shanghainese (wuu-CN), Slovak (sk-SK), Spanish (es-419), Spanish (es-CL), Spanish (es-CO), Spanish (es-ES), Spanish (es-MX), Spanish (es-US), Swedish (sv-SE), Thai (th-TH), Turkish (tr-TR), Ukrainian (uk-UA), Vietnamese (vi-VN)


## Views

KeyboardKit Pro adds dictation-related views to the ``Dictation`` namespace, to let you quickly add dictation visualization to your app:

@TabNavigator {
    
    @Tab("Screen") {
        
        @Row {
            @Column {
                ![DictationScreen](dictationscreen)
            }
            @Column {
                KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a ``Dictation``.``Dictation/Screen`` that overlays your app with a dictation view when dictation is active.
                
                This view can be styled with a ``Dictation/ScreenStyle``, which can be applied with a ``SwiftUICore/View/dictationScreenStyle(_:)`` modifier.
            }
        }
    }
    
    @Tab("BarVisualizer") {
        
        @Row {
            @Column {
                ![DictationScreen](dictationscreen)
            }
            @Column {
                KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a ``Dictation/BarVisualizer`` that renders a set of animated bars. You can change the number of bars, colors, etc.
                
                This view can be styled with a ``Dictation/BarVisualizerStyle``, which can be applied with a ``SwiftUICore/View/dictationScreenStyle(_:)`` modifier.
            }
        }
    }
}

## How to...


### ...perform dictation

Dictation works differently in an app, where microphone access is available, and in a keyboard extension, where it's not. You can use a ``DictationService`` to perform dictation from both your keyboard extension and the main app.

To make your keyboard extension start dictation, just call ``DictationService/startDictationFromKeyboard()`` or trigger a ``KeyboardAction/dictation`` action. This will open the main app, perform dictation, then (try to) return to the keyboard and apply the result.

Dictation will work automatically if you set up KeyboardKit with a ``KeyboardApp``, as is described in <doc:Getting-Started-Article>, and set up the app to handle dictation, as described further down.


### ...manage keyboard/app navigation

Due to Apple's restrictions on how apps can interact with eachother, KeyboardKit Pro will use ``KeyboardHostApplication`` to *try* to identify the keyboard host application, then navigate back to it using a deep link. 

If the host application is *not* known or can't be opened, the user can still tap the top leading back arrow to navigate back to the last app. If the ``DictationContext`` `keyboardHostApplication` is nil, your app should point your users to that back arrow.

See the <doc:Host-Article> for more information on which apps that are currently supported, and how to add more apps to this database.



### ... set up dictation

This section describes how to set up an app to start dictation from its keyboard extension and perform the dictation in the main app.


#### Step 1 - Set up the required permissions

Before you can start dictation, you must add these keys to your app's `Info.plist`, otherwise the app will crash at runtime:

```
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Describe why you need microphone access.</string>
<key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>
<string>Describe why you need speech recognition.</string>
```


#### Step 2 - Create an App Group

To share data between your app and keyboard extension, you must setup a shared app group for both targets:

@Row {
    @Column {
        ![Set up an App Group for the app](dictation-appgroup-app)        
    }
    @Column {
        ![Set up an App Group for the keyboard](dictation-appgroup-keyboard)       
    }
}

Add this App Group ID to your ``KeyboardApp``'s ``KeyboardApp/appGroupId`` property, to properly set up dictation for the keyboard and its main app.


#### Step 3 - Create a deep link

To make it possible for the keyboard to open the app and start dictation, you must set up a deep link URL scheme for the app target:

![Set up a URL Scheme for the app](dictation-url-scheme)

Add this deep link to your ``KeyboardApp``'s ``KeyboardApp/deepLinks-swift.property`` property, to properly set up deep linking for the keyboard and its main app.


#### Step 4 - Create a speech recognizer

KeyboardKit uses a ``DictationSpeechRecognizer`` protocol to decouple KeyboardKit from the Speech framework, to avoid having to specify dictation permissions in apps that don't use dictation.

Here's a standard speech recognizer implementation that you can add to your app and inject into the keyboard dictation view modifier:

```swift
import KeyboardKitPro
import Speech

public extension DictationSpeechRecognizer where Self == StandardSpeechRecognizer {

    static var standard: Self { .init() }
} 

public class StandardSpeechRecognizer: DictationSpeechRecognizer {

    public init() {}

    private var recognizer: SFSpeechRecognizer?
    private var request: SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest?
    private var speechRecognizerTask: SFSpeechRecognitionTask?

    private typealias Err = Dictation.ServiceError

    public var authorizationStatus: Dictation.AuthorizationStatus {
        SFSpeechRecognizer.authorizationStatus().keyboardDictationStatus
    }

    public var supportedLocales: [Locale] {
        Array(SFSpeechRecognizer.supportedLocales())
    }

    public func requestDictationAuthorization() async throws -> Dictation.AuthorizationStatus {
        await withCheckedContinuation { continuation in
            SFSpeechRecognizer.requestAuthorization { status in
                continuation.resume(returning: status.keyboardDictationStatus)
            }
        }
    }

    public func resetDictationResult() async throws {}

    public func startDictation(
        with locale: Locale
    ) async throws {
        try await startDictation(
            with: locale,
            resultHandler: nil
        )
    }

    public func startDictation(
        with locale: Locale,
        resultHandler: ((Dictation.SpeechRecognizerResult) -> Void)?
    ) async throws {
        recognizer = SFSpeechRecognizer(locale: locale)
        guard let recognizer else { throw Err.missingSpeechRecognizer }
        request = SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest()
        request?.shouldReportPartialResults = true
        guard let request else { throw Err.missingSpeechRecognitionRequest }
        speechRecognizerTask = recognizer.recognitionTask(with: request) {
            let result = Dictation.SpeechRecognizerResult(
                dictatedText: $0?.bestTranscription.formattedString,
                error: $1,
                isFinal: $0?.isFinal ?? true)
            resultHandler?(result)
        }
    }

    public func stopDictation() async throws {
        request?.endAudio()
        request = nil
        speechRecognizerTask?.cancel()
        speechRecognizerTask = nil
    }

    public func setupAudioEngineBuffer(_ buffer: AVAudioPCMBuffer) {
        request?.append(buffer)
    }
}
```


#### Step 5 - Set up dictation in your keyboard extension

To set up dictation for your keyboard extension, just set up your keyboard with a ``KeyboardApp`` that defines a ``KeyboardApp/DeepLinks-swift.struct/dictation`` deep link, or an ``KeyboardApp/DeepLinks-swift.struct/app`` deep link with the standard dictation pattern. See the <doc:Getting-Started-Article> article for more information.


#### Step 6 - Set up dictation in your main application

To even be able to start dictation in the main app from the keyboard, make sure to set up the ``KeyboardApp/DeepLinks-swift.struct/dictation`` deep link in your application. 

Next, wrap your app in a  ``KeyboardAppView`` as described in <doc:Getting-Started-Article>, then apply the **.keyboardDictation** view modifier to it:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {

    @Environment(\.openURL) var openURL
    
    @EnvironmentObject var dictationContext: DictationContext
    @EnvironmentObject var keyboardContext: KeyboardContext

    var body: some View {
        ...
        .keyboardDictation(
            dictationContext: dictationContext,
            keyboardContext: keyboardContext,
            openUrl: openURL,
            speechRecognizer: .standard,         // As defined earlier
            overlay: dictationOverlay            // You can use any view
        )
    }

    func overlay() -> some View {
        Dictation.Screen(
            dictationContext: context,
            titleView: { EmptyView() },
            indicator: { Dictation.BarVisualizer(isAnimating: $0) }
        )
    } 
}
```

The keyboard dictation view modifier has an overlay parameter that defines the view to show while dictation is active. You can use the Pro dictation ``Dictation/Screen`` with any of the built-in dictation visualizers, or a completely custom view.

#### Step 7 - Perform dictation

You can now start dictation in your keyboard by triggering a ``KeyboardAction/dictation`` action or by calling ``DictationService/startDictationFromKeyboard()``. 

You can override ``KeyboardInputViewController/viewWillHandleDictationResult()`` to customize how the keyboard controller handles the dictation result. If not, the keyboard will automatically send the dictated text to the host application.
