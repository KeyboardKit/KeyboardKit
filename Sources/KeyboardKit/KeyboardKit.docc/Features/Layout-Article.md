The keyboard layout of a software keyboard can vary between locales and devices, which means that a layout engine must be flexible.

In KeyboardKit, a ``KeyboardLayout`` is used to define the full set of keys to add to a keyboard. A keyboard layout can be created from an ``KeyboardLayout/InputSet``, which just defines the input keys and allows us to reuse identical layouts for many compatible input sets.

ðŸ‘‘ [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks more input sets, like QWERTZ, and AZERTY, as well as localized input sets and layouts for all ``Foundation/Locale/keyboardKitSupported`` locales in your license. More information about Pro features can be found further down.

## Namespace

KeyboardKit has a ``KeyboardLayout`` type that is also a namespace for other layout-related types like ``KeyboardLayout/DeviceConfiguration-swift.struct``, which has a ``KeyboardLayout/DeviceConfiguration-swift.struct/standard(for:)`` function that returns the standard configuration for the current context.



## Input Sets & Layouts

In KeyboardKit an ``KeyboardLayout/InputSet`` specifies the input keys of a keyboard. KeyboardKit comes with a couple of pre-defined input sets, like ``KeyboardLayout/InputSet/qwerty``, ``KeyboardLayout/InputSet/numeric(currency:)``, etc.

You can generate a ``KeyboardLayout`` from an alphabetic, numeric, and symbolic input set. Some locales support multiple ``Keyboard/LayoutType``s and can be added multiple times with different layouts, like ``Keyboard/LayoutType/qwerty``, ``Keyboard/LayoutType/colemak``, ``Keyboard/LayoutType/dvorak``, etc.



## Services (DEPRECATED)

In KeyboardKit, a ``KeyboardLayoutService`` can generate dynamic layouts at runtime, It provides us with the flexibility we need, to accomodate to the varying needs for different locales, devices, etc.

KeyboardKit injects a ``KeyboardLayout/StandardLayoutService`` into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services``. You can replace it at any time, as described further down, or add custom services to it with ``KeyboardLayoutService/tryRegisterLocalizedService(_:)``.

> Important: This service model is soft deprecated and will be removed in KeyboardKit 10. Please use the new keyboard layout value builders to create custom layouts that you can then inject into ``KeyboardView``.


## Keyboard Layout Customization

You can inject a custom keyboard layout into the ``KeyboardView`` if you don't want to use the standard layout, which will vary based on device, orientation, locale, etc. 

You can base a custom layout on the ``KeyboardLayout/standard(for:)`` layout, then customize it in any way you want before injecting it into the view:

```swift
// See the demo app for a better, interactive example.
struct MyKeyboardView: View {

    let state: Keyboard.State
    let services: Keyboard.Services
    let context: KeyboardContext { state.keyboardContext }
    
    var body: some View {
        KeyboardView(
            layout: layout,
            ...
        )
    }

    var layout: KeyboardLayout {
        var layout = KeyboardLayout.standard(for: context)
        // Customize the layout here
        return layout
    }
}
```

You can use the convenient layout functions that KeyboardKit provides to insert, remove, replace, and modify items within the layout.

## ðŸ‘‘ KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks more input sets, like ``KeyboardLayout/InputSet/qwertz``, ``KeyboardLayout/InputSet/azerty``, ``KeyboardLayout/InputSet/colemak`` and ``KeyboardLayout/InputSet/dvorak``, as well as localized input sets and layouts for all ``Foundation/Locale/keyboardKitSupported`` locales that are included in your license.

KeyboardKit Pro will automatically set up all input sets and layout services in your license, and use them when you change ``KeyboardContext/locale`` and ``KeyboardContext/keyboardLayoutType``. You can also use them individually, as standalone features: 

```swift
let alphabetic = try InputSet.swedish
let numeric = try InputSet.swedishNumeric
let symbolic = try InputSet.swedishSymbolic
let layout = try KeyboardLayout.swedish(for: keyboardContext)
```

These input sets and services will throw a license error if you try to access them without first registering a valid KeyboardKit Pro license. 

If you are on the Basic or Silver plan, you must specify which locales to use in your ``KeyboardApp``. See <doc:Getting-Started-Article> for instructions.


### iPad Pro Support

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks an ``KeyboardLayout/iPadProLayoutService`` that can generate iPad Pro-specific layouts for most supported locales.

![iPad Pro Layout](keyboardview-ipadpro)

> Important: This layout will replace the ``KeyboardLayout/iPadLayoutService`` and become the standard iPad layout in KeyboardKit 10.


### Keyboard Layout Extensions

KeyboardKit Pro extends ``KeyboardLayout`` and to make it easier to add, remove, and replace items. 

See ``KeyboardLayout`` and the nested layout ``KeyboardLayout/Item`` type in the KeyboardKit Pro documentation for a full list of additional capabilities.


### Locales With Multiple Layouts

KeyboardKit Pro extends ``Foundation/Locale`` with a list of ``Foundation/Locale/supportedLayoutTypes`` and makes the ``KeyboardApp/LocaleScreen`` add a layout picker to all added locales that support multiple layouts. 

* **Catalan**: QWERY - Catalan, QWERTY, AZERTY, QWERTZ, Colemak, Dvorak

* **Vietnamese** TELEX, VIQR, VNI (QWERTY, AZERTY, QWERTZ for all)
* **Welsh**: QWERTY, AZERTY, QWERTZ, Colemak, Dvorak

All ``KeyboardLayout/ProLayoutService`` implementations use the ``KeyboardContext/keyboardLayoutType`` to adjust their alphabetic input set for the current type.

## How to...

### ...create a custom layout service

You can create a custom ``KeyboardLayoutService`` to customize the layout for a certain locale, device type, or complete layout.

You can implement the ``KeyboardLayoutService`` protocol from scratch, or inherit and customize ``KeyboardLayout/StandardLayoutService`` or any of the available ``KeyboardLayout/iPadLayoutService``, ``KeyboardLayout/iPadProLayoutService``, or ``KeyboardLayout/iPhoneLayoutService`` base classes:

```swift
class CustomKeyboardLayoutService: KeyboardLayout.StandardLayoutService {
    
    override func keyboardLayout(for context: KeyboardContext) -> KeyboardLayout {
        var layout = super.keyboardLayout(for: context)
        // Perform any modifications here
        // ðŸ’¡ KeyboardKit Pro unlocks many layout extensions
        return layout
    }
}
```

To use your custom service instead of the standard one, just inject it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` by replacing its ``Keyboard/Services/layoutService`` property:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        services.layoutService = CustomKeyboardLayoutService()
    }
}
```

This will make KeyboardKit use your custom implementation instead of the standard one.


### ...customize a localized layout service

Service that inherit ``KeyboardLayout/StandardLayoutService`` can use ``KeyboardLayoutService/tryRegisterLocalizedService(_:)`` or the ``Keyboard/Services`` convenient ``Keyboard/Services/tryRegisterLocalizedLayoutService(_:)`` function to register a custom service for a certain locale, for instance:

```swift
class MyCustomGermanService: KeyboardLayout.ProLayoutService.German { ... } 

class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        setup(for: ...) { result in
            // Check result to see that setup was successful
            self.services.tryRegisterLocalizedLayoutService(
                try! MyCustomGermanService() 
            )
        }
    }
}
```

This makes it easy to replace the service for a certain locale, since you can inherit and customize the related ``KeyboardLayout/ProLayoutService``.


### ...customize the layout for a certain locale

Most ``KeyboardLayout/ProLayoutService`` implementations in KeyboardKit Pro lets you specify custom input sets when you initialize them. This can for instance be used to use another alphabetic layout for locales that support it: 

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        setup(for: ...) { _ in
            // Check result to see that setup was successful
            try? self?.services.tryRegisterLocalizedLayoutService(
                KeyboardLayout.ProLayoutService.English(
                    alphabeticInputSet: try? .qwertz
                )
            )
        }
    }
}
```

You can use the ``Foundation/Locale/supportedLayoutTypes`` information that KeyboardKit Pro unlocks to check if a locale supports a certain layout. A layout service that is provided with an unsupported layout type may render it incorrectly.


### ...override the layout type for a certain locale

KeyboardKit has a ``KeyboardContext/selectLocale(_:layoutType:)`` that can be used to set both the ``KeyboardContext/locale`` and ``KeyboardContext/keyboardLayoutType``. The layout type will be used to override the default layout type of certain layout services.

This function is automatically used when you use the ``KeyboardSettings/addedLocales`` collection to manually set a keyboard layout type for a certain locale. Both the ``KeyboardContext/selectNextLocale()`` and the ``Foundation/Locale/ContextMenu`` will use this function to set both properties properly.
