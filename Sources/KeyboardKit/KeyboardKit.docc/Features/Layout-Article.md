The keyboard layout of a software keyboard can vary between locales and devices, which means that a layout engine must be flexible.

In KeyboardKit, an ``InputSet`` can define the input keys, after which a ``KeyboardLayout`` can be created to define the full set of keys. KeyboardKit defines some input sets like ``InputSet/qwerty`` as well as a standard, English keyboard layout.

ðŸ‘‘ [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks more input sets, as well as localized input sets and layouts for all ``Foundation/Locale/keyboardKitSupported`` locales in your license. Information about Pro features can be found further down.

## Namespace

KeyboardKit has a ``KeyboardLayout`` type that is also a namespace for other layout-related types like ``KeyboardLayout/DeviceConfiguration-swift.struct``, which has a ``KeyboardLayout/DeviceConfiguration-swift.struct/standard(for:)`` function that returns the standard configuration for the current context.



## Input Sets & Layouts

In KeyboardKit an ``InputSet`` specifies the input keys of a keyboard. KeyboardKit comes with a couple of pre-defined input sets, like ``InputSet/qwerty``, ``InputSet/numeric(currency:)``, and ``InputSet/symbolic(currencies:)``.

You can generate a ``KeyboardLayout`` from an alphabetic, numeric, and symbolic input set. Some locales support multiple ``Keyboard/LayoutType``s, which means that you can support ``Keyboard/LayoutType/colemak``, ``Keyboard/LayoutType/dvorak``, etc. with a single layout.



## Services (DEPRECATED)

In KeyboardKit, a ``KeyboardLayoutService`` can generate dynamic layouts at runtime, It provides us with the flexibility we need, to accomodate to the varying needs for different locales, devices, etc.

KeyboardKit injects a ``KeyboardLayout/StandardLayoutService`` into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services``. You can replace it at any time, as described further down, or add custom services to it with ``KeyboardLayoutService/tryRegisterLocalizedService(_:)``.

> Important: This service model is soft deprecated and will be removed in KeyboardKit 10. Please migrate to the new view-based customization approach described in the next section, if you are a KeyboardKit Pro user. Non pro-users have to wait until KeyboardKit 10.


## Keyboard Layout Customization

You can use the ``SwiftUICore/View/keyboardLayout(_:)`` view modifier to customize the standard keyboard layout, which can depend on the current locale, device, orientation, etc:

```swift
// See the demo app for a better, interactive example.
struct MyKeyboardView: View {

    let state: Keyboard.State
    let services: Keyboard.Services
    let context: KeyboardContext { state.keyboardContext }
    
    var body: some View {
        ... // Insert the view to use here, for instance a KeyboardView
            .keyboardLayout { params in
                var layout = params.standardLayout(for: context)
                // Customize the layout here
                return layout
            }
    }
}
```

You can create a completely custom layout from scratch, or customize the ``KeyboardLayout/LayoutBuilderParams/standardLayout(for:)`` to add and/or remove items.

## ðŸ‘‘ KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks more input sets, like ``InputSet/qwertz``, ``InputSet/azerty``, ``InputSet/colemak`` and ``InputSet/dvorak``, as well as localized input sets and layouts for all ``Foundation/Locale/keyboardKitSupported`` locales that are included in your license.

KeyboardKit Pro will automatically set up all input sets and layout services in your license, and use them when you change ``KeyboardContext/locale`` and ``KeyboardContext/keyboardLayoutType``. You can also use them individually, as standalone features: 

```swift
let alphabetic = try InputSet.swedish
let numeric = try InputSet.swedishNumeric
let symbolic = try InputSet.swedishSymbolic
let layout = try KeyboardLayout.swedish(for: keyboardContext)
```

These input sets and services will throw a license error if you try to access them without first registering a valid KeyboardKit Pro license. 

If you are on the Basic or Silver plan, you must specify which locales to use in your ``KeyboardApp``. See <doc:Getting-Started-Article> for instructions.


### iPad Pro Support

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks an ``KeyboardLayout/iPadProLayoutService`` that can generate iPad Pro-specific layouts for most supported locales.

![iPad Pro Layout](keyboardview-ipadpro)

> Important: This layout will replace the ``KeyboardLayout/iPadLayoutService`` and become the standard iPad layout in KeyboardKit 10.


### Keyboard Layout Extensions

KeyboardKit Pro extends ``KeyboardLayout`` and to make it easier to add, remove, and replace items. 

See ``KeyboardLayout`` and the nested layout ``KeyboardLayout/Item`` type in the KeyboardKit Pro documentation for a full list of additional capabilities.


### Locales With Multiple Layouts

KeyboardKit Pro extends ``Foundation/Locale`` with a list of ``Foundation/Locale/supportedLayoutTypes`` and makes the ``KeyboardApp/LocaleScreen`` add a layout picker to all added locales that support multiple layouts.

* **Vietnamese** TELEX, VIQR, VNI (QWERTY, AZERTY, QWERTZ for all)
* **Welsh**: QWERTY, AZERTY, QWERTZ, Colemak, Dvorak

All ``KeyboardLayout/ProLayoutService`` implementations use the ``KeyboardContext/keyboardLayoutType`` to adjust their alphabetic input set for the current type.

## How to...

### ...create a custom layout service

You can create a custom ``KeyboardLayoutService`` to customize the layout for a certain locale, device type, or complete layout.

You can implement the ``KeyboardLayoutService`` protocol from scratch, or inherit and customize ``KeyboardLayout/StandardLayoutService`` or any of the available ``KeyboardLayout/iPadLayoutService``, ``KeyboardLayout/iPadProLayoutService``, or ``KeyboardLayout/iPhoneLayoutService`` base classes:

```swift
class CustomKeyboardLayoutService: KeyboardLayout.StandardLayoutService {
    
    override func keyboardLayout(for context: KeyboardContext) -> KeyboardLayout {
        var layout = super.keyboardLayout(for: context)
        // Perform any modifications here
        // ðŸ’¡ KeyboardKit Pro unlocks many layout extensions
        return layout
    }
}
```

To use your custom service instead of the standard one, just inject it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` by replacing its ``Keyboard/Services/layoutService`` property:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        services.layoutService = CustomKeyboardLayoutService()
    }
}
```

This will make KeyboardKit use your custom implementation instead of the standard one.


### ...customize a localized layout service

Service that inherit ``KeyboardLayout/StandardLayoutService`` can use ``KeyboardLayoutService/tryRegisterLocalizedService(_:)`` or the ``Keyboard/Services`` convenient ``Keyboard/Services/tryRegisterLocalizedLayoutService(_:)`` function to register a custom service for a certain locale, for instance:

```swift
class MyCustomGermanService: KeyboardLayout.ProLayoutService.German { ... } 

class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        setup(for: ...) { result in
            // Check result to see that setup was successful
            self.services.tryRegisterLocalizedLayoutService(
                try! MyCustomGermanService() 
            )
        }
    }
}
```

This makes it easy to replace the service for a certain locale, since you can inherit and customize the related ``KeyboardLayout/ProLayoutService``.


### ...customize the layout for a certain locale

Most ``KeyboardLayout/ProLayoutService`` implementations in KeyboardKit Pro lets you specify custom input sets when you initialize them. This can for instance be used to use another alphabetic layout for locales that support it: 

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        setup(for: ...) { _ in
            // Check result to see that setup was successful
            try? self?.services.tryRegisterLocalizedLayoutService(
                KeyboardLayout.ProLayoutService.English(
                    alphabeticInputSet: try? .qwertz
                )
            )
        }
    }
}
```

You can use the ``Foundation/Locale/supportedLayoutTypes`` information that KeyboardKit Pro unlocks to check if a locale supports a certain layout. A layout service that is provided with an unsupported layout type may render it incorrectly.


### ...override the layout type for a certain locale

KeyboardKit has a ``KeyboardContext/selectLocale(_:layoutType:)`` that can be used to set both the ``KeyboardContext/locale`` and ``KeyboardContext/keyboardLayoutType``. The layout type will be used to override the default layout type of certain layout services.

This function is automatically used when you use the ``KeyboardSettings/addedLocales`` collection to manually set a keyboard layout type for a certain locale. Both the ``KeyboardContext/selectNextLocale()`` and the ``Foundation/Locale/ContextMenu`` will use this function to set both properties properly.
