/// This protocol can be implemented by any classes that can
/// provide dynamic keyboard styles.
///
/// While most views in the library have view modifiers that
/// apply their specific styles, some views are more complex
/// and require more dynamic styling.
///
/// For instance, the ``KeyboardView`` embeds many different
/// components like the ``EmojiKeyboard`` which define their
/// own styles. For now, this service generates these styles,
/// which means that a view rendered within a ``KeyboardView``
/// can't be styled with their dedicated view modifiers.
///
/// KeyboardKit will automatically setup a standard protocol
/// implementation in ``KeyboardInputViewController/services``
/// when the keyboard is launched. You can change or replace
/// it at any time to customize the keyboard action behavior.
