 This protocol can be implemented by classes that can return
 keyboard layouts for the current keyboard state.
 
 `KeyboardKit` will automatically create a standard instance
 and bind it to the input view controller when the extension
 is started. It can be replaced with a custom one by setting
 the `keyboardLayoutProvider` property.
