/// This class has observable states and persistent settings
/// for the core keyboard functionality.
///
/// This class syncs with ``KeyboardInputViewController`` to
/// keep up to date. It's extensively used in the library to
/// make state-based decisions, and automatically update the
/// ``KeyboardView`` whenever the context changes.
///
/// You can use ``locale`` to get and set the current locale,
/// which also set the keyboard primary language, as well as
/// ``keyboardLayoutType`` to get and set the current layout.
/// Since the values typically go hand in hand, make sure to
/// set both when e.g. enabling English with a Dvorak layout.
/// A future major version should redesign this to make sure
/// that you can't set these incorrectly.
///
/// Note that the ``locale`` and ``keyboardLayoutType`` sync
/// from and to the ``settings-swift.property``, which is an
/// approach that persists the values while also keeping the
/// values observable. Since the context only syncs these at
/// launch, make sure to only use the context properties.
///
/// You can use ``locales`` to define which locales that you
/// want to enable for the keyboard. This list is used until
/// you add any locales to ``KeyboardSettings/addedLocales``,
/// which then takes precedene over ``locales``. You can use
/// ``enabledLocales`` to resolve the valid, underlying list.
/// If ``enabledLocales`` has multiple locales, you can loop
/// through the collection with ``selectNextLocale()``.
///
/// This class also has observable auto-persisted ``settings``
/// that can be used to configure the behavior and presented
/// to users in e.g. a settings screen.
///
/// KeyboardKit set up an instance of this class and injects
/// it as an environment value when you set up your main app
/// and keyboard, as shown in <doc:Getting-Started-Article>.
